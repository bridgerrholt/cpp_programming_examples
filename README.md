# C++ Programming Examples
Examples for programmers who want to learn C++. Not necessarily for programming beginners.

## Compiling and Running
The use of an IDE is recommended, just make sure to have a new project for each example.

The compiler flag -std=c++11 should always be used as most examples require it.
